#  Exploratory Data Analysis of Resumes using the Big Five Personality Model

This project is a deep dive into applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) and data science techniques to analyze a dataset of over 2,400 resumes. The primary goal is to infer the Big Five personality traits â€” **Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism** â€” based on linguistic patterns found in the text.

The analysis, completed as part of the *Programming with Data* coursework, provides a unique perspective on how individuals express personality in professional contexts, offering insights that could be valuable for **recruitment, career counseling, or professional development**.

##  Key Features

###  Comprehensive Text Preprocessing
Developed a robust pipeline for cleaning and preparing raw resume text using fundamental NLP techniques from the NLTK library, including:
- **Tokenization**: Breaking down text into individual words  
- **Stopword Removal**: Eliminating common, non-essential words  
- **Lemmatization**: Reducing words to their base form  
- **Regex Cleaning**: Using regular expressions for systematic cleanup  

###  Trait Scoring & Feature Engineering
Developed a scoring system to quantify Big Five personality traits by combining:
- **Sentiment Analysis (VADER)**: Measuring emotional tone  
- **Keyword Mapping**: Using curated word lists tied to each trait  
- **Vocabulary Richness**: Evaluating language diversity per resume  

###  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Conducted EDA to uncover patterns and correlations between personality traits and job sectors.

###  Visualizations
Created visualizations using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** to clearly present insights, including bar charts and heatmaps.

##  Results & Key Insights

- **Creative roles** (e.g., designers, artists) scored highest in **Openness**, reflecting creativity and imagination  
- **Technical roles** (e.g., developers, engineers) scored highest in **Conscientiousness** and lowest in **Neuroticism**, suggesting strong organization and emotional stability  
- **Management roles** emphasized both **Agreeableness** and **Conscientiousness**, aligning with leadership qualities
